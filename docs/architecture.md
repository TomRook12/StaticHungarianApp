# Architecture

## Overview

Magyar Otthon is a **single-file React app**. All lesson data, business logic, and UI live in `src/App.jsx`. This is intentional — the app is small, the deployment target is a static host, and keeping everything in one file makes offline reading and AI-assisted editing straightforward.

## Data model

```
PHASES[]          — 8 thematic groups (Morning, Going Out, Playing, …)
LESSONS[]         — 35+ lesson objects, each belonging to one phase
  └─ phrases[]    — array of { hu, pr, en } (Hungarian, pronunciation, English)
```

Each lesson also has:
- `aud` — target audience: `"kids"` or `"wife"`
- `tip` — a short teaching note
- `pat` — optional grammar pattern note

## State

All runtime state lives in two places:

| Location | What |
|----------|------|
| React `useState` | UI state — current screen, selected lesson, active question, etc. |
| `localStorage` | Persisted stats via the `useStats` hook |

`useStats` exposes: `recordPhrase`, `recordSession`, `startTimer`, `stopTimer`, `getWeakPhrases`, `setDailyGoal`.

Stats schema (key: `"magyarStats"`):
```js
{
  totalTime,       // seconds
  dailyTime,       // { "Mon Jan 01 2025": seconds }
  streakDays,      // ["Mon Jan 01 2025", …]
  lessonScores,    // { lessonId: { best, attempts } }
  phraseScores,    // { huText: { right, wrong } }
  dailyGoal,       // minutes
}
```

## Daily Focus Engine

`getDailyFocus(stats)` scores every lesson based on:
1. **Time of day** — `TIME_TAGS` maps hour ranges to lesson IDs
2. **Day of week** — `WEEKEND_BOOST` / `WEEKDAY_BOOST` arrays
3. **Weakness** — phrase error rate from `phraseScores`
4. **Recency** — lessons not recently attempted score higher

Returns the top-scored lesson and a human-readable reason string.

## Quiz engine

`generateQuestions(lesson, weakPhrases, count)` produces a mixed question set from six types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mc_en_hu` | English prompt → pick Hungarian |
| `mc_hu_en` | Hungarian prompt → pick English |
| `type` | English prompt → type Hungarian |
| `tf` | Hungarian prompt → true/false English match |
| `fill` | English prompt → fill missing word in Hungarian sentence |
| `match` | Match 4 pairs (shown as a pairing UI) |

Weak phrases (wrong > 0) are over-represented in the pool.

## Speech

`speakHu(text)` uses the Web Speech API (`SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, `lang="hu-HU"`, `rate=0.85`). Falls back silently if unavailable.

## Feedback

`FeedbackModal` posts directly to the GitHub Issues API (`tomrook12/statichungarianapp`) with a category and description. No backend required.

## Navigation model

Single-page, screen-based navigation managed with a `view` state string:

```
"home" → "phases" → "lessons" → "lesson" → "quiz" → "result"
                                          → "stats"
```

No router library; `onBack` callbacks walk back up the stack.

## Build & deploy

- `vite build` — outputs to `dist/`
- `vite.config.js` `base: '/StaticHungarianApp/'` must match the GitHub Pages sub-path
- `npm run deploy` — runs `vite build && gh-pages -d dist`
